So when I checked Slaven Belupo's schedule like I said before, there was a surprise

The UEFA Europa League qualifiers. A chance for amazing money and a Conference League spot if I fall in either hurdle. And honestly when I saw this I instantly wanted to apply. But this angered me so much honestly

They wanted to give their caretaker a shot in the QUALIFIYING ROUNDS of a UEFA COMPETITION. My headtop was on Mars I swear because given where my reputation is at you'd think they'd just fall on the floor and hire me.

But I had to wait. The caretaker managed to go past the second qualifying round and seeing that they drew the first leg, the mail dropped in my inbox:

After an uncomfortable conversation with the Al-Fayha chariperson I managed to negotiate a long term deal for this contract and once the t's were crossed and i's were dotted, it was official:

Yes it was indeed a coup given my reputation high. But it was a lot of pros which is what why I took this wild shot in the dark. We have a chance to get money from qualifying for the Europa League. And it is ultimately a journey to get to Manchester so this is a step to that. Our first steps in Europe begins now. From the AFC Champions League Elite(Even if I haven't managed one game for them) to official UEFA Europa League business. Let's get it.
