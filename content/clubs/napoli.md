Napoli is one of Italy’s most storied clubs, combining southern passion, legendary players, and recent top-level success:

### Historical Highlights

Founded: 1926 (roots go back to 1905)

Location: Naples, Campania

Home Ground: Stadio Diego Armando Maradona (previously San Paolo)

Major Honours:

Serie A titles: 4 (1987, 1990, 2023, 2025)

Coppa Italia: 6 (1962, 1976, 1987, 2012, 2014, 2020)

Supercoppa Italiana: 2 (1990, 2014)

UEFA Cup (Europa League): 1 (1989)

### Maradona Era and Iconic Status

Maradona's Arrival (1984–1991): Launched Napoli to unprecedented heights, winning their first league titles (1987, 1990) and the UEFA Cup in 1989.

Became the symbol of southern Italian pride, breaking northern dominance.

### Recent Decades and Revival

Financial Collapse (late 1990s–2000s): Napoli endured relegation and bankruptcy but was refounded in 2004 by Aurelio De Laurentiis.

Rapid promotions led to a Serie A return in 2007.

From the 2010s onward, consistently a top-six club, regularly qualifying for European competitions.

Modern Era (2020s)
2022–23 and 2024–25: Won the Serie A title for the first time since Maradona’s era, with standout attacking football and recruitment.

Champions League quarter-final appearance for the first time in history (2023).

Coppa Italia and Supercup Success: Added further silverware, including the Coppa Italia (2020) and Supercoppa (2014).

Recent managers have included Spalletti, Garcia, and most recently Conte (It was Conte but I am replacing Mourinho).

## In our save

Napoli finished 3rd and 4th in Serie A in the previous two seasons—a step below expectations but still strong.

Won Coppa Italia (2023/24) and Supercup (2024/25)—showing cup pedigree and retaining winning potential.

Currently languishing in 13th place when I take over—underperformance compared to real-life dominance and past league success.

## Club Identity and Expectations

Known for attacking, creative football and boisterous support.

High ambitions: challenging for Serie A, deep European runs, constant pressure from fans and board.

Famous for developing and attracting stars (Maradona, Cavani, Hamsik, Koulibaly, Osimhen, Kvaratskhelia, recent star signings).

Naples is football-mad—success brings legendary status, failure brings intense scrutiny and regular managerial changes.

There are only two words to really say about a job of this magnitude and fan base as big as this:
