The first 3 games were absolutely torrid. Only the majority of them. Let me walk you through them.

We started off with your classic smash and grab. A 1-0 win away to Delhi FC who were mid table and had so many better players for sure.

The shot comparison says it all on how much of a smash and grab it was when you don't dominate as much but steal all the points after a peach of a cross was met with a great header.

But the reality check hit hard in the next 2 matches with a loss to Real Kashmir who were meant to be in the relegation battle with us apparently and Kashi who were in the top 4 of the league before the transfer window opens.

I hated watching this match so much because we definitely deserved more than the one goal we scored. The fact that our only goal was a non open play goal was appalling.

Then the second one. The definition of fully shut out:

Definitely did not deserve a draw let alone a win. They were at the top half of the table so it was to be expected. Their frontline ran rings around our defenders. We needed something from the transfer window badly.

## Transfer window round up

My checklist:

- Goalie
- Full back(Left and right)
- Midfielder

I never realized how horrible the market is for full backs. There was only 2 star level full backs everywhere I looked. I did nab a good foreign goalie which was 2 and half to 3 stars which was a much needed improvement.The only full backs I got were only capable backups so it's just fit and pray at this point honestly. I did get a decent pickup at striker on a free but he was foreign too. And a depth option at center back who was foreign too.

The reason why I keep pointing that out is that the I-League has very strict rules on Foreign players. You can only register 6 and have only 4 in the starting 11. So it will be a rotation among other things.

### The people I think were good pickups

Just spent 1k GBP for this guy. He's 33 and takes a foreign slot but it's better than playing a way shorter 16 year old youngster. Nothing against the youngster but he's short for a keeper.

Cost around 4k GBP. Thankfully with a few sales and moving out players I was able to afford this guy. I was confused as to how he is a better natural at striker but honestly I just need an extra backup badly. He could be something hopefully.

Another 1k GBP. It came out of nowhere but his height could be useful in a league where the heights aren't that high. The worry is the foreign player slot and that I can only use 4 in the lineup and given 3 are used for the goalie and defenders it is going to be a squeeze to use him

A suggestion from the Technical Director who was really forcing foreign players when I so desperately needed more Indian players. And he actually seems decent enough to probably move the other guy I'm using more to his preferred position. Which means I will have no foreigners in the attack but right now I need a solid defense.

## Alright. Business is wrapped up and this is how the table looks like

We're plumb last with some teams around us still somehow having games in hand. It's not looking good unless we start getting more points in draws or wins.

This is how I'm planning the team for the time being:

I have ben thinking that I could bring the foreign attackers on for a burst against tiring legs so maybe that just could work in certain matches.

Onwards to the second half of the season
