I have become such a humongous FM24 nut lately. Especially after the next iteration was cancelled. I have been watching a journeyman save on YouTube recently which had me hooked even more. And I also realize that I have never EVER been interested in a journeyman save. My most recent save was starting unemployed in England and after 3 clubs I was at Manchester United one of my favorite clubs ever:

So now I thought: "Why not do a real journeyman save?".

## So HERE IS MY PLAN

I am going to undertake a journey. Travelling all the way from India to Manchester where my favorite club in the world Man United reside at. We will start from the very bottom, try to get a job in India get the coaching badges and build our reputation and move through nations till I reach Manchester United once again.

I will be using the same air mile system as the other journeyman save which can be seen below:

And for an idea on what leagues are available to manage in, take a look below:

I will be tallying a lot of the cost it takes for many things besides the miles I get every season and details over the jobs I take and many moments over this save game as a whole.

## The miles count to aim for to move from India to Manchester is 8350 miles

## So let's get stuck in. Keep following this site for updates on everything
