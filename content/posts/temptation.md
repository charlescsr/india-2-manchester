Bit of a quick update on something I noticed in January.

I wanted so many foreign players but with our dimmed reputation it just honestly wasn't to be. Not many people were interested in us. Maybe it's because we are technically in the Second Division among other reasons like the fact that they are seriously good quality for this team as a whole.

But we did get a few decent options incoming for the next season honestly. One was free and the other was money and set for next season.

I remember Martin Vitik from my time in the other save. When I was Borussia Dortmund in that save, he was one of the first defenders I bought for my new system in that save. So safe to say I wanted him in badly. The issue is he has got a release clause of 30M GBP and I am not sure how that will work really.

The other player who will come after his contract expires is for our LB. He is a better improvement over who we have so I'll take it.

As I was just looking at Job Security something popped up there:

Now I seriously was super tempted. Al-Ittihad are one of the pillars of the Saudi Pro League and they were seriously floundering in 7th to 8th in the league and they were in the AFC Champions League to boot as well so they had a good season last time out.

Their budget is a huge step up and right now they are far away from the qualifying spots for the AFC Champions League.

But with a big reputation club comes big reputation managers. If it does open up I really truly hope they can see my reputation rise and take a chance.
