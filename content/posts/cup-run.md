I know I said I'd bring the transfer plans soon but given the Cup Run and a chance at winning 500 miles I did need to cover it.

We had a fairly decent Super Cup run which shocked the hell out of me before FC Goa ruined it completely. The Super Cup would have given us a valuable 500 miles but I'll take the miles from the wins and goals and we did have some.

The fact the results against the ISL clubs weren't thumpings like I expected showed me how much of a difference sharpness and morale helps. And the fact we beat two teams who were at the top of the I-League to qualify to the Super Cup to begin with was insane.

Let me walk you through the results.

First was a win against Inter Kashi which was surprisingly dominant and we were lethal when it really mattered.

It also helped when their key player fell foul of an injury during the match which really helped our chances so much more honestly.

Then it was an extra time victory over the I-League champions in Mohammedan SC.

It could have gone either way but their shooting was horrible. And after going to a 2 striker narrow formation the guy who I thought would be good for his height FINALLY scores his first ever goal for Aizawl. And them losing one of their key foreign players helped a little bit too. But we managed to qualify for the Super Cup. And we got shacked up with 3 other ISL teams: Jamshedpur, FC Goa and Bengaluru FC.

I honestly wasn't expecting much on things but I somehow started believing after seeing this result

Shooting wasn't amazing. First off there was a dodgy penalty given for them and barring that they absolutely were not that lethal to be honest. And then a sub I brought on managed to score a crazy equalizer. And then the set pieces I set up came in clutch after our star player defender managed to get the winner and we came away with 3 points.

Then it all came crashing down when we faced off against FC Goa.

There was one player they freaking had who was seriously a very decent player and he ran rings around us managing to set up both of their goals. I thought we could somehow scam a draw but it wasn't to be.

Then it all ended on a whimper after Goa won their final game too to qualify so this dead rubber against Bengaluru was just not ideal to end it all.

Which meant the table looked like so

I do have transfer plans in place and I have set up some transfers a bit but actually:

## Aizawl FC are rumoured to be in a potential board takeover

I remember my last club had one which was taken over by someone. If it's a tycoon we could actually be in a good place in terms of budget. We have 2 incomings still in progress so they could be getting canceled because takeovers usually put a transfer embargo until the takeover is complete.

## The next post will be around if a takeover happens and the transfers I have finished up
