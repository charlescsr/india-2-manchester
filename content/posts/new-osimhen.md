We interrupt the regularly scheduled January program for something that happened which made me wonder a bit and it was a VERY expensive signing.

First up the match against my old club in Trabzonspor was more close than it should have been but we got the points to skip the knockout playoff round and the win against Chelsea was so important because we pipped them to the final spot in the Top 8.

There wasn't a lot of change but I knew the important weaknesses. In the end the lamp post I have did the job scoring the winner.

Towards the end of the January window I realized 3 of the big players in the locker room were worried about the lack of depth up front which surprised me given I had Lucca and Lukaku already(Even if Lukaku was lured by Saudi). So my options were Samu from Porto or Bowen from West Ham. In the end when I did put the bid in we faced off against Barcelona for his signature which is why I had Bowen as a backup if he rejected us. And in the end this mail wound up showing up which surprised the hell out of me

I didn't have this much money lying around trust me. I gave everything I have in the current budget with a mega installment deal which made this work. It was more like a "I wasn't expecting to get it" situation but looking at the installments I've strapped Napoli with it feels like a "I'm never going to financially recover from this ðŸ˜…".

But this apparently broke a transfer record:

He has very VERY good attributes in all honesty. A very physical beast who has good movement without the ball who is only 23 and can only get better. Could be the right replacement for Osimhen. The new Osimhem

With that deal it meant Serie A out of nowhere were the big spenders in January:

It's a surprise because the Premier League usually spends more. But then again it is January and not the summer.

So we managed to move to the top of the table and the lead looks good but a tiny slip and we will lose ground because I have promised UCL football and that is the main draw for a lot of players.

Some were narrow and some felt like a smash and grab and of course a debut goal from the big money striker in Samu definitely helps.

We're looking strong for the league which is definitely something I am hoping we can get over the line. And a deep UCL run definitely helps our coefficient for an extra spot too. Let's see how we do.
