Starting unemployed in FM24-especially with no coaching badges-means nobody will really pick you up. I knew that from previous experience

So it became a game of hitting Continue and waiting for the managers to fall. Cold-blooded, I know, but in this game of managers you need to have that edge.

And eventually it did-Twice:

These 2 clubs were at the very bottom of the I-League which is India's 2nd divison and in danger of being relegated to the 3rd tier so they need a relegation specialist(Think defend and counter and nothing else). Hardly glamourous but beggars can't be choosers. I had to apply for both of them.

Now it was a waiting game but Aizawl got the first foot in:

Gee thanks for the vote of confidence. Seems like the previous manager had a very poor dressing room atmosphere and of course the results didn't help with things either.

After a bit of waiting around for the second interview a huge bit of news dropped in my inbox: the contract offer. And after signing on the dotted line, it was official.
