Looking into the books of Trabzonspor we got a lot of debt that is difficult to remove. And it goes till freaking 2030. It feels weird doing this because I want to do some managing not repairing this stupid debt.

A quick finance lesson for those names are as  follows:

* The bank loan is basically paid each month and is adjusted so that it will be paid by the end of that date
* A Payment In Kind loan means interest builds up and we would only know how much it really is at the end of that loan....in 2030 ðŸ˜‘.

On the pitch we are doing well actually. We had a few narrow wins but it was all wins which pushed us from 12th to around 5th which was towards a Continental Competition qualifying round.

Off the pitch everything was freaking falling apart. We had two big players for us who will explore options at the end of their contract:

I mean Savic was a solid presence in the back after I had to tweak my tactics to suit his veteran age honestly and Yokuslu was a good enough player and a fairly solid team leader and captain. I thought I remembered his name from somewhere and it was in fact from when he played for West Brom when they were in the Premier League.

Another thing I had to remember was that the foreign player limit was going down to 12 in the next season so I would wind up needing more of a focus on Turkish players too and with Trabzonspor's non-existent youth recruitment that seems unlikely. The only thing I am thinking about is to probably use our reputation to sway Turkish players away from other places as much as I can but with Insecure finances and me using the bulk of the budget on a decent Turkish LB I didn't have much.

And as for Andre Onana well he was honestly very decent....until him and another standout player for us had to go for the African Cup of Nations leaving us with a 2 star Turkish keeper. I wasn't having that so I had to dive deep into the pockets for a loan signing of a 2.5 star Turkish keeper. Better than nothing.

I do have some intriguing names available on a free transfer but their wage demands are stupidly high. When we have this kind of a salary structure:

And the players wanted well above that it was a joke. And the fact that our two top earners were injured and on loan(We are still paying his salary as he is on freaking loan which infuriates me ðŸ˜ )

I think I need a purge before I can even get good players in to begin with. Payroll wise it looks shocking.

One free transfer I think we could use even if he is on the decline was this guy:

I am pretty sure our reputation supercedes Getafe but I hope this works. Our finishing has been horrendously lackluster and I could use him to help our finishing and scoring. Because we are creating chances. It's about putting them away.

Given my healthy mile bank of roughly 1500 miles I have options to move just in case this is unsalvageable:

If we manage to win the Turkish Cup that should give us 500 miles which will push our mile bank to 2000 which means we could finally have a shot at any of the major nations and they have insecure job security too. Or a sideways step is AEK. I did notice they were insecure and I wanted that job but later on it became secure before going to Turkey. If AEK does open up and no other major nation wants me I will keep an eye out.

Right now it feels like this gif to be honest with what Savic and Yokuslu are doing:

## I think the main story is will I do the same or actually stay?
