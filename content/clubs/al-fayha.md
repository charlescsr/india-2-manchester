I have no experience on any of the clubs in Saudi barring Al-Nassr and that is flimsy as it is because of Cristiano Ronaldo. So looking around for this club was actually fairly enlightening. Have a look:

### Al-Fayha FC: History & Context

* Founded: 1953, in Al Majma’ah, Saudi Arabia.

* One of the oldest clubs in the region and the oldest in its city.

* Formed from a merger between two local teams (Minikh and Al-Fayha) to represent Al Majma’ah.

### Nickname: Al-Burtuqali (The Orange)—from their kit colors

## League Journey & Achievements

* Primarily spent its history in Saudi Arabia’s lower divisions, but has grown in prominence recently:

* First reached Saudi’s First Division (second tier) in 1985.

* Cycles of promotion and relegation followed: spent several seasons in both the top and second tiers.
  * 2013–14: Won the Saudi Second Division (third tier).
  
  * 2016–17: Promoted to the Saudi Pro League (top tier) for the very first time as First Division champions. This was a historic rise.
  
  * 2021–22: Won their first ever King’s Cup (Saudi’s premier domestic cup) with a dramatic upset, defeating Al Hilal on penalties.
  
  * 2023–24: Qualified for their first-ever AFC Champions League, reaching the Round of 16.

These guys are a fairly ambitious lot given their rise all the way to the Saudi Pro League. And their King's Cup win was against a giant in Al-Hilal as well to boot which seems to be absolutely huge.

Their finances are fairly healthy in this save but I will be hamstrung given I'm in the second division with a limit of only 5 foreign players compared to 10 in the Pro League.

## The honor roll

## A fairly ambitious team for an ambitious me. Let's have it
