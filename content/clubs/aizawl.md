So I am learning about this club for the first myself as well so let's go on a journey together to understand what this club is about and why are they in a slump.

A quick glance of this club I managed to fetch from the internet was this:

* Founded: 1984; based in Aizawl, Mizoram; home ground Rajiv Gandhi Stadium (≈20,000).

* Breakthrough: Promoted to the I‑League in 2015–16 after winning the 2nd Division in 2015(Remember that this was before the ISL was recognized as India's top division)

* Peak: Historic I‑League champions in 2016–17 under Khalid Jamil—the first team from India’s Northeast to win the national league title.

* Recent form: Typically mid/lower table in the I‑League.

* Identity: Heavy reliance on local Mizoram talent and academy grads; strong home support; “The People’s Club” culture

Got to say this club was surprised me. Especially their out of nowhere title in 2016-17 and their dominance in their local league. They have a decent enough youth academy from what I could see in game atleast and they have a few decent youth prospects just like it is in real life. And their fans are passionate like your typical community club and they seem to absolutely dominate the . But now the slump to the relegation zone at this current moment does not surprise me. My style of play has always been rock and roll football with flair. But now is the first time I will quite literally be playing absorb and counter attack.

The honor roll:
