Got to say this league was a step up in terms of finance. And it showed. This was the transfer history so far.

There are a few more incomings which aren't accounted for so keep that in mind. Compared to barely a million back in India this was quite a huge leap. The main reason I needed to shell a lot of money is to offset the halving of foreign players. Given the fact you can only have 5 foreigners in the second division of Saudi now people having to leave because of me reducing those numbers in the registration and of course the obvious reason(The club's relegation) the money from sales weren't that high. It was painful to have so many people come and want to leave but I was given the money to gut this squad and that's what I'm going to do.

At least with the transfers done, our season prediction seems good for promotion even if it hasn't changed:

Al-Raed have a crazy set of foreign players. I do need to recon to see who they unregistered to see if they are beatable. Because I am not someone who is okay with just promotion. Given my end goal to reach Manchester, I want to win the Yelo League. I need to earn that 442oons SPL gif with a winner's medal in the second division. And I want that 500 miles because the King's Cup won't be easy to win.

Right now it's hoping and praying that the bigger foreign players don't get offers. I have contingency plans if they ever get offers but it's easier if they don't have offers.

With the transfers sorted out my lineup is looking a bit like this:

One of the defenders I brought in on loan after he rejected a free transfer to us is off to the Asian Games unfortunately. So he will not be in the lineup for now. Right now the starting wingers are the one who are prone to offers. So here's hoping their offers do not come close to what I promised(Maybe it's time for the FM24 dark arts)
