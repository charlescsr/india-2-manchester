I never expected these lot to ever be in this situation but here we are. I always thought Greek football meant these guys that's how dominant they usually seemed to be. And even now seeing them only having Conference League football just feels sad.

What I was able to gather was this:

Olympiacos F.C. is the undisputed giant of Greek football, founded in 1925 and based in Piraeus, Athens. Over nearly a century, the club built up a record-breaking legacy with:

* 48 Greek league titles

* 29 Greek Cups (plus 19 "doubles")

* 4 Super Cups

A string of domestic dominance—far outpacing all rivals (the next highest league title tally in Greece is just 12)

The first and only Greek club to win a major European trophy(Asterisk here because that season is not what Olympiacos had)

Olympiacos has never been relegated from the Greek top flight. Their legendary status comes from a remarkable history of streaks—including seven consecutive league wins twice (1997–2003, 2011–17) and other unbeaten runs.

Internationally, they reached new heights with their UEFA Europa Conference League triumph in 2023–24—the first by a Greek club, capping a legendary spring with a dramatic 1–0 win over Fiorentina and a famous comeback against Maccabi Tel Aviv. Just weeks earlier, their youth team won the UEFA Youth League. This was considered by many as the greatest achievement in Greek club football since Greece’s national team won Euro 2004.

But... after all this success, the FM24 save game presents a different, more unsettled Olympiacos:

In 2023/24 of your save:

* finished only 4th place in the Championship Group of the Super League

* Only runners up in the Greek Cup

* Forced into the Europa Conference League—not the Champions League where their fans expect them

Looking at it, there is an intriguing storyline where I will be trying to replicate their European triumph which should have happened in the previous season a year later. Looking at how Olympiacos have done IRL they are back to their dominant nature in the current season which is where I am at the start of.

## The honor roll

## Can I replicate Olympiacos' IRL season exactly? Let's see
