I did manage to set our highest earner for release because of his shoddy injury record mainly and he just isn't good enough for the club. I had some sales that came in which definitely helped us repair the damage and it pulled us FINALLY in the damn green which gave us some space but for only free transfers.

And given we could finally fight, I saw someone available on a free transfer who I was actually able to afford:

2014 World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez. He was an exciting player all the way back who got a dream move for many to Real Madrid after his exploits in that World Cup in Brazil. And honestly given he's lost a lot of physical stats, I am still working to maintain his stupidly high technical and mental attributes. He's our bonafide corner taker and given who I have up front that I haven't talked about yet he will have a ball.

And a welcome boost was the owner managing to make funds available for us after we made it into the green of course and looking at Andre Onana's value I could give a very good layered deal to sign him permanently but when I asked his agent despite United accepting the offer:

Dammit. I'll be back when we are officially good to participate in the UEFA competitions.

And as for who we have up front that I have been covering up it is none other than the former Southampton LAMP POST of a striker in Paul Onuachu:

Having 20 Jumping reach as a freaking 6 foot 7 striker is a damn cheat code at times. And the 21 goals he's scored is a testament to that.

And James is the best beneficiary of that and this was our scoring chart:

You best believe almost all of those 10 assists were from corners ðŸ˜†.

This was a fairly quick post so next up would be if we have a shot at 500 miles in the Turkish Cup. With Galatasaray still in the competition they still have a chance.
