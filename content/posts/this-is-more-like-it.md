We were hugely dominant in the Yelo League and we needed a draw or win against Al-Raed(Ironic because they were meant to be up there with us). And we managed to deliver.

This was a disasterclass in shooting is what it was but honestly a win is a win. The only thing I really had was honestly nervousness. The problem with them was that they had a manager with a 3 at the back system(Always hard to break down in FM24) and they have Svilar still present between the sticks(Surprised me that nobody really wanted to trigger his active relegation release clause).

We first went ahead with a set piece that was bundled in by the CB who was alert to the rebound after the free kick hit the post. Then the second was a good goal even if there was a deflection. Their final consolation was from a set piece which they manage to score from just outside the box. It annoyed me only a little bit because it was one of those well hit goals you can't stop really.

But with this win we have officially secured promotion to the Saudi Pro League.

And with that I got a few articles which I didn't expect to see as well

The table looks like this with games still left to go

I mean we have made a mockery of the league scoring 97 goals so far. Given we still have matches to go, I want to hit that 100 goal mark because every mile helps.

I know I was tempted by the Al-Ittihad job being insecure. It still is. But given the fact that we will be a SPL team soon, doors finally opened and we were able to convince a good chunk of foreign talent to take a punt with us.

This is the list of foreigners incoming(Almost done pending contract talks)

Mega step up in payroll but not that big a dent in terms of transfer budget. I did talk about Vitik before and Oglive is essentially my LB option who will sit as an extra CB.

The others well I had them marked out well before January and now was when I could really bring them with the keeper and Ayari.

Let's walk through those players

A much needed keeper for the Pro League. I liked Moreira but thankfully he's only in on loan so once he's gone this guy will slot in seamlessly. The only thing that is a con is his dislike for important matches.

Backup level only honestly which he accepted. A big reason why I wanted him was because of his love for big matches. Given he will only have the occasional start, I don't mind the lack of consistency.

Very sudden opportunity that came via intermediaries. I was planning on someone on a free transfer but seeing that Wober wanted to join? I cancelled the offer I made for the other guy and went for him instead. Left footed which is a rarity as it is in the world of football. So I am excited for him to pair with Vitik. Two aerial beasts from set pieces is going to hit hard in the Pro League.

Had him penciled in for a very long time but he was never interested. And given Brighton don't look like they were going to renew his contract and so with the promotion he finally wanted to join. He slots in as one of my CM's easily which is just perfect.

Somebody I am worrying about because the medical revealed that he is susceptible to injuries. It'll be a difficult job so I need a very capable Saudi backup striker.

This might mean I would have to remove 2 foreigners to make sure I register everyone so maybe we are seeing 2 that could possibly go once everyone comes in.

Honestly with this level of business I am not that fussed if I get the Al-Ittihad job or not, there are other opportunities for some fine players from intermediaries too which I am on the lookout for.

## I will be finishing the second half of the season along with transfer business too and see who I can bring in
