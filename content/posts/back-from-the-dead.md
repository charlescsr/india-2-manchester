I managed to reset to a new save with the exact same reputation. I did think whether to take a vacation till the end of the first season because of how hard coded the UEFA competitions are. They are in the usual group style and will change next season to the bigger league phase but I did want to see if a good rep club comes calling in the mid season.

Something that made me laugh was seeing Manchester United sack Amorim and this mail dropped out of nowhere:

Right. Time to wrap up the save then. We are making it to Manchester ðŸ˜‚. Just kidding. I am going to decline because it is hands down beyond my miles bank. I did get other interviews from other decent clubs too which I still had to decline.

After a while of waiting and watching after recreating everything this is what popped up till now:

There were some good clubs who were insecure but they wound up stabilizing eventually. Trabzonspor was my only option. I did want to stay away because their finances were insecure. And even with a background rich benefactor I did notice their loan debt be at 120M. And given I restarted this save again after managing to bring the data update files, managing them would also mean looking at THIS guy again:

Andre Onana. Sigh. Well could be worse. But if I don't pick a job now I would need to wait and I don't know if reputation goes down if I wait a whole year. So I decided to apply.

And it was going well. I was the leading candidate

No other decent enough job seemed to be open which matched my reputation(3.5 stars) so I decided to go for it.

And once the contract was accepted, it was official:

We got work to do. Because there is a reason why this team is lingering in mid table and there is a large amount of debt to try and clear eventually.

I did think about Slaven Belupo again but honestly they are dangerously close to relegation and I don't want to handle that again after what happened with Aizawl.

## Club history will be added soon as well along with the old save game clubs

## The mile bank currently stands at a healthy 1587 after using 1090 to travel to Trabzon
