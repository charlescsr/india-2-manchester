This club surprised me. I always thought Besiktas, Galatasaray and those clubs were the head honchos of the Turkish league but these guys aren't meant to be slouches either. What I found was as follows:

Trabzonspor is among Turkey’s most historic clubs, holding a unique spot as the first champion outside Istanbul and regularly competing for honors in the Süper Lig. The club enjoyed a golden era in the 1970s and early 1980s, winning six of their seven league titles in that period, and finally broke a 38-year drought by claiming the 2021–22 Süper Lig championship under coach Abdullah Avcı.

Historical Süper Lig Standing (Up to 2022–23)
Golden era: Six league titles between 1975–76 and 1983–84; renowned for breaking Istanbul club dominance.

Modern success: 2021–22 league champions, the seventh title overall, and a major resurgence for the club and its passionate fanbase.

2022–23 season: Finished 6th in the Süper Lig with 17 wins, 6 draws, 13 losses, 64 goals scored, and 54 conceded.

Regularly qualifies for European competitions and holds 9 Turkish Cup victories and 9 Super Cup titles.

Recent Form and 2023–24 Season Snapshot
In the current save, by matchday 12 Trabzonspor have played 12 matches with 5 wins, 2 draws, and 5 losses, scoring 14 and conceding 14.

This balanced record (mid-table, even goal difference) is below their recent peak but reflects a club in transition—not far removed from a championship but rebuilding after a drop in the league.

Club Legacy and Identity
Trabzonspor remains famed for passionate supporters, a fierce home environment, and a tradition of producing top national talent.

Key legends include Şenol Güneş, Hami Mandıralı, Cemil Usta, with modern heroes like Anastasios Bakasetas and Anthony Nwakaeme driving the resurgence.

The club’s claret and blue colors are iconic in Turkish football, symbolizing both their regional pride and outsider status versus Istanbul’s giants.

## We got a monster debt to clear and this club definitely needs Europe and the money from that to clear the debts. That is my main goal
