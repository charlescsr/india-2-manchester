A relatively smaller post after what happened. After seeing how we are doing, I want to aim for the ISL and the Super Cup and adding that to our mile bank along with the goal and win miles too will finally help us make the move into the Middle East.

Given I would reach my Continental C License by the end of this season, I am aiming to not stay in India if I wind up winning both the ISL and the Super Cup because ultimately this is a journeyman save for a reason. So looking at the job security at the moment this is what I found:

The one job that pops out to me is the job in the UAE with Al-Jazira(UAE) which is insecure and rich(My kind of combo if I'm job hunting). Other than that I am looking at Qatar as the only other option.

There are Saudi Pro League jobs open but Al-Raed is the only thing that might be too far and those kinds of clubs would want so much more in terms of rep and also badges so I think I will definitely be laughed off.

This is quite literally what they'll do to me when I apply to those Saudi Pro League jobs:

The only possible jobs available in the second division of Saudi has poor finances too. So it's either Qatar or the UAE.
