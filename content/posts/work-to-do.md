For the Yelo League we just needed a win over a team that was already meant to be relegated and you know what we do by now:

![2f0799b78ea375c2e56dcdca61ee9442.png](/india-2-manchester/images/2f0799b78ea375c2e56dcdca61ee9442.png)

Very dominant and it could have been more but the job was done. That was 500 to the bank officially and finally done:

The less said about our match against Al-Nassr the better:

To be fair I will give my team this, we went down a man in the first freaking half and holding it at 0-0 when these were the stats:

I will honestly take it when we have 3 less foreigners than them. So that was as far as we went in the King's Cup which appeased the board somewhat but I hate losing.

Another match that caught me out so much was a dead rubber game against Al-Riyadh which went like so:

![98abd76c18892d18827d99a16e64cfb4.png](/india-2-manchester/images/98abd76c18892d18827d99a16e64cfb4.png)

![e147182c86c0cc1e76822a363c2ecf15.png](/india-2-manchester/images/e147182c86c0cc1e76822a363c2ecf15.png)

Their shot accuracy was bonkers. But in the end our new star player in Hannibal freaking Mejbri was the one who scored a freaking hattrick to win it for us. And yes there is a story behind why that guy is in our team. His contract was mutually terminated by Manchester United and before he was snapped up a Tunisian team(He is from Tunisia) I took him in(I wish free agent transfers had an option for them to start at the end of the season but I think it defeats the purpose of free transfers). So I had to move people around to accomodate him in but I think it was worth it.

So once the season was done. Unbeaten of course with a supreme glut of goals this was our tally in the table:

![8244c774b7ee6e19560e7d16c3a1d0ba.png](/india-2-manchester/images/8244c774b7ee6e19560e7d16c3a1d0ba.png)

Al-Raed and Al-Riyadh who were meant to come up with us never did. Instead it was Al-Adalah and Al-Hazem to join us back to the:

Let me tell you I have been WAITING to use that one and it hits the spot beautifully.

But once I was there, there were two bombshells waiting for me:

![6e634a222c39c7ee498a6149e4367cd7.png](/india-2-manchester/images/6e634a222c39c7ee498a6149e4367cd7.png)
Two of the pillars of the SPL sacked their managers. I knew it was a long shot but I applied anyway. And I waited and waited and waited but sadly:

![39107d448de781e5b88026bd39020d52.png](/india-2-manchester/images/39107d448de781e5b88026bd39020d52.png)

![81509a4a71276270f5cc7fc6eb1601d6.png](/india-2-manchester/images/81509a4a71276270f5cc7fc6eb1601d6.png)

Set pieces. I wish I could do them but I had people who could barely win the headers in them. All because I didn't have a button enabled in the tactics(It was Play For Set Pieces). Given the talent I am bringing in I do plan to have fun with my overpowered set pieces routines so these rejections got me looking at it exactly like this:

![I'll make you eat your words](https://media.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZmo5cHowYnRuaHR2a3E4bnVkazlmcWxxamc3N3c1Nzk1eTdtYnhndyZlcD12MV9naWZzX3NlYXJjaCZjdD1n/k4LXks3GlcpxK/giphy.gif)

And in the end these were the managers they went with:

To be fair I will give them fair props to this because I respect the hell out of Jose. He's going to be a pain to play against but I am looking forward to it.

The second one is what I don't agree with:

![0d30fa81cea78dd744de1c9d64702d2b.png](/india-2-manchester/images/0d30fa81cea78dd744de1c9d64702d2b.png)

Roberto freaking Mancini. That guy was surviving off of international football with Saudi Arabia. Lazy bums decided to go with him for a club like Al-Nassr.

With the players I got coming in we got Aerial and Physical beasts from corners. And this time I will keep that button on this time.

However coming to the SPL raised a problem for us.

## The thing about SPL registration limits

![405e5fc07c601e505c3fba49123d3d81.png](/india-2-manchester/images/405e5fc07c601e505c3fba49123d3d81.png)

I could only technically get 8 foreign players over 21. So the foreign players would usually wind up being 8.

So because of that I had to say no to a few of my future transfers. So I had to cancel a few like the Ayari transfer because I had one that was coming in for the LB position. So I had to cancel the backup RB because I found a good Saudi talent there anyway.

So with the foreign talent we got in this is how our position looks like so:

![3577fee4d5c1258d57db0d5a8184f5b5.png](/india-2-manchester/images/3577fee4d5c1258d57db0d5a8184f5b5.png)

I want to really badly get to that place below the top 4 and be ready to capitalize if something happens. And this time I want to really stick it to those clubs who rejected me because of my set pieces. Well now I got 2 monsters in Vitik and Wober. And Hannibal is decent enough to take corners as well.

The SPL will now see what happens when you don't give me the opportunity I deserve.
