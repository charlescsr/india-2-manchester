We managed to end our era in Saudi Arabia with a fantastic UNBEATEN double with both the Saudi Pro League and the King's Cup.

First thing that popped out to me was that our SPL match against Al-Qadsiah was the last time in the existing stadium apparently:

The King's Cup final delivered in terms of the rivalry with a close match but we were on the right side of it:

We did do well to go ahead by 2 goals but our stupid backup couldn't even save the long shot even if one of our defenders made the mistake to begin with. But we held on either way and we managed to get 1500 miles for the SPL and King's Cup to cap our era in Saudi Arabia.

## So our current mile bank after tallying the count stands at 2677

With that we have a chance to take the journey to either Croatia or Greece as our next step. Because when I checked out Job Security:

Al-Nassr have really seriously underperformed even with their new manager. So did Al-Ahli. And Galtier's contract is expiring with Al-Hilal as well so there is another chance to rebuild a giant of Saudi Arabia whenever it opens up. But another particular job all the way in Greece looks enticing ðŸ¤”

Managed by FREAKING Raul(Real Madrid legend who had the 7 before Cristiano Ronaldo took it), they have missed out on the UEFA Qualifying rounds and they are backed by a background rich benefactor. It differs from the Underwriter benefactor at my current club in a better way.

And honestly given this is how my manager profile looks like:

It matches my reputation too. And by the time the end of the current year rolls around I'll have the top most coaching badge as well. So I am honestly watching to see how it looks like there.

# My options

Given I won both the SPL and King's Cup with Al-Fayha miles won't count again in terms of a repeat double. So if I win the trophies again those miles don't count. Unless I change clubs they won't. The only trophy miles that would count is the AFC Champions League Elite which we qualified for.

So at this point if the Olympiacos job opens up I am going to go for it. Otherwise I will want to go for one of the big Saudi clubs to rebuild them to become league winners again.

Anyways I am leaving Al-Fayha in good hands. I managed to finalize a few Saudi signings which is always very important in this league given I am only allowed 8 foreign players.

# The result?

Olympiacos stuck with Raul despite them losing a half star in reputation. I am surprised about that given their history. And sadly the only club that is open is a mid table club in Croatia who lost their coach to the national team but it is a 3 star reputation club and my reputation is easily above 3 stars.

Slaven Belupo is the club that you can see there. Their rating as a whole is fairly shocking but they actually had a little surprise when I checked their schedule.
