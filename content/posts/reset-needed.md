I might need to do a reset of this save. Let me explain what happened.

So it is November in the save game and the Europa League playoff hasn't happened yet. When it should have been happening well before that at the end of August.

From what I researched about this, it seems I used just a league unlocker file instead of the European Extended file which fixes the continental competitions too to draw them all properly. And it is difficult to fix this unless I start a new save game with the right league file.

# So the plan at the moment is this

I will try a new save out to see what happens for now. I will replicate my entire manager profile(sans trophies because that is difficult to bring) and attributes and Continental Pro License.

Given my mile bank stood at 2677 at the end of my time at Al-Fayha, I have a shot at any of Croatia, Greece and Turkey. So I will start unemployed again with the same reputation, attributes and everything so that we can see who will I get AND also to see if the UEFA Competitions work properly.

Think of this is as my version of GTA 5's Dead Man Walking where Davey knocks Micheal out and he "comes back" from the dead again.

We were doing well actually. We were up there with Hajduk Split despite the lack of Europa League action which was the main reason I took this job for. But sadly this means I will be resetting to see who comes through this time.
