We finished up the I-League and Super Cup runs. We finished unbeaten with only one draw and in the Super Cup we had a much better run going all the way to the final before getting owned by Kerala Blasters in the final(As a Chennaiyin native that hurt so much to watch). But it was all around a much better cup run than last year.

Let's go through the matches that stood out to me:

We had a ding dong match to end the league against Sudeva Delhi who went toe to toe for a while with us for promotion but I never saw it coming especially in a dead rubber game.

Onto the Super Cup matches and we easily beat the two teams to qualify with wins over Neroca

And Churchill Brothers which were really dominant:

The groups were the same as the last season with the likes of Jamshedpur, Goa and Bengaluru once again. And this time: We were READY.

First up, a great win against Bengaluru FC:

Then another great win after we lost to FC Goa last time out:

Then after a goalless draw against Jamshedpur(Stupid 3 at the back system is always torrid to play against) we were finally through this time. And we faced off against Mumbai City FC who finished 2nd in the ISL League Phase and honestly the score line was so damn weird for the fact that THEY lost a man:

I thought we could be out of sight before they pulled back in the second half. Then we managed to grit the win out making the numerical advantage really count.

But it all came crashing down when we got dominated by Kerala Blasters:

Along with what was a dodgy penalty to begin with they really managed to finish each of their clear cut chances honestly. And we barely got anything in the game barring Jackichand Singh pulling one back as a consolation which just felt pointless really.

But the season is over and tallying the miles up we managed to amass 677 miles. We need at the very least 2k miles if we have to go into the Arab countries really to begin with(Maybe I should have really added more close by leagues)

But in a way this is kind of like building a nation along with a journeyman save.

And looking around there was jobs available in the ISL even after our promotion but watching their finances they had nothing really which made me feel like it would be a lot to bring it back to the green really.

Adding to that though I got this in my inbox too:

Our spending was too much for the politician really(Sorry not sorry). So we had a proper takeover in progress and it was taken over by someone.

It sounded like around everything it was just a promotion from within rather than a tycoon takeover but it brought the balance back to the green so I'm happy to stay really.

This was the details of the awards and accolades through the season:

A supremely good season all around and I was happy with the promotion and we are now officially in the Indian Super League and since we're in the top division we got another cup we're in now: The Durand Cup. And we have also started on the top most National coaching badge too. So we are on the up in terms of badges too.

### Transfer post next up with some players who look like they'll leave as soon as they came because I seemed to have messed up a bit
