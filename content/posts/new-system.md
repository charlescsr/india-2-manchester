I would like to start this post off by saying that we are going to be going full on Amorim for this chapter in Greece:

We had a very good transfer window really and the difference in class with this team compared to the rest of the teams feels nice when you're ONE OF said clubs in a different class. A few of the signings I made:

* Lafont: Noticed he was there in the previous season playing for a different team and given he plays for a team that is in Ligue 2(A league I haven't enabled), I decided to bring him in because he was in the media dream eleven. And after what I saw how horrible my existing keeper was I wanted this guy instantly. A bit of a lot to pay for him which was 8.5M but honestly he will be worth it.

* Diallo and Vallejo: I definitely needed more defenders for the new system and also align with the board objectives of signing high rep players so these guys were brought in. Althought I am regretting bringing in Vallejo because of how injury prone he seems to be.

* Castagne: Fulham were on a mad one when they first transfer listed Antonee Robinson of all people and he seemed like a good option to battle with Onyemaechi really but then his interest to come to our club wasn't there but we had a good option when they also transfer listed Castagne and he was a much better option than what we had on the right side with a 34 year old Brazilian and someone who was having one foot out the door. For his backup I nabbed Moussa Wague on a free who is also adept on both right and left sides of the wide positions.

* Perrone: Tameze that you see there was an already confirmed transfer by the time I came in but I do want someone else there and I'll show you who that is. This guy however was such a good pickup from Como(A club where Baturina also plays but he annoyingly wanted too much wages ðŸ˜¢. Here is where I wish our history was still there. Baturina was a beast at Al-Fayha). He seems like a good player to fit the Regista role in this system so I will try to train him to become that.

* Dia: Taremi wanted to explore his options at the end of his contract and I wanted to move him on soon and Dia felt like the best replacement I could find even if he's on the shorter side he still comes with the board objective of signing high rep players.

As for who I'm bringing in to start alongside Perrone, Aston Villa did a weird thing so I'm capitalizing on it

He's that kind of player who is the big man in the midfield who will be our destroyer type in a way.

The other players were there when I joined the club already. The funny thing is Jesse Lingard rejected me at Trabzonspor for this very club and with how the registration rules are like for the UEFA competitions I couldn't really fit him in and so I wound up selling him ðŸ˜‚.

As for the Conference League qualification we did well.

First up was an amateur side from Finland and the less said about the aggregate score the better ðŸ˜…

Then it was Plovdiv from Bulgaria and they did fight back a bit but they were no match in the end:

And finally it was Lugano from Switzerland and it was dominant once again despite them pulling level for a few minutes:

And with that we were officially in the Conference League and the fixtures were as follows:

The main matches seemed to be Lille and APOEL but other than that we should be beating the other teams. But seeing that Newcastle of all teams are in that competition was super annoying. And when I checked their team their manager was freaking Conte who also plays a three at the back system. The knockouts are going to be interesting.

As for the big teams in the Super League we did face off against AEK and the result gave me confidence:

The reason why I felt confident was because I was seriously scared when I lost my first friendly not gonna lie ðŸ˜… so seeing the system work perfectly is just what I wanted to see.

So let's see how we do in the Conference League because the League looks good compared to the rest of the teams.
