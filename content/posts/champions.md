The main important match was against Rajasthan United which required a win for us to seal the I-League title and we definitely had to deliver.

And I am pleased to report: WE DID. We managed to get the win we required and we are I-League winners. 500 miles in the bank. We still have to tally the miles from the wins and goals from the season but I also have to remind you we still have a Super Cup to play as well and we are much better than we were the last time we were there in that competition.

Let's cover the match as a whole to begin with first:

We first managed to get off to a good start with our new debutant Indian forward scoring a great goal. But they managed to pull level after a corner and a great cross to someone who had acres of space to finish easily. But we managed to get the eventual winner after Fredrick's header hit the post but the rebound fell kindly to Chatterjee who has been there for me since Day 1 at Aizawl. He scored the first goal of my tenure here and here he was scoring the winner for the game that makes us I-League champions.

And we had done it officially:

The last time this plucky Mizoram outfit won the I-League was an unlikely title in 2016-17 and we have probably replicated it even if we were shown to be favorites to win the league.

Speaking of the last time, Khalid Jamil was the coach who guided Aizawl to said unlikely title back then. He was a head coach at Jamshedpur in the ISL who I beat in the Super Cup which caught me out. So I appreciate it.

What's even better is I managed to coax the board to send me on the second set of coaching badges as well:

We still got 5 more rungs to go in the coaching ladder. But things are looking up. I will tally up the miles total we have after finishing up the League and Super Cup.
