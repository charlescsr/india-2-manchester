Yes I did manage to win my first ever Conference League. In my previous save game I only won the Europa League and the Champions League. Never the Conference League. But we managed to get through and pull through. We will get into it in time.

## First up: The perfect replacement for Vezo

Ruben Vezo our vice captain was a decent player honestly but given he was hitting 32 and also on a decline his performances were also fairly shaky. So after asking his agent I managed to get an offer from the Portuguese league and he will close his career out at home.

So for his replacement I had the perfect person in mind.

Greek. Home grown and still fairly good. Probably the best replacement we could have found for Vezo. He will slot right in as the third defender fairly easily.

## The big knockouts: We SHOWED UP

First up was Newcastle like I said before and we somehow managed to show up and our home advantage helped even more

Dia finally FINALLY delivered. After a very cagey first half the second half delivered. Newcastle did equalize through Joelinton of all people(Confused as to why Joelinton is still good at striker when he was a midfielder to begin with). Then Barrios came as a sub and he's really developed well recently and for a January signing he was good and his corner was met by the head of Diallo to put us ahead before Dia completed the rout.

Then going to England for what is the first time in this save game we held on to the aggregate lead and only restricted them to one goal and we did equalise too.

In all honesty, both sides were HORROR in terms of shooting but the goal Newcastle scored was a goddamn BELTER from Tonali. Given they were being aggressive we did manage to take advantage of that and our system was perfect to prevent them from scoring. And we also weren't any better but we did manage to equalize through Barrios who once again delivered.

After this finished we were set to face off against Lazio in the final

As for the awards after finishing the League season off, there were some nice surprises:

![Screenshot 2025-09-26 154022.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20154022.png)

I do want to give him a new deal for sure because the big clubs like Milan and Inter wanted him and I couldn't really find someone who could replace him at the moment.

![Screenshot 2025-09-26 154008.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20154008.png)

I mean this really showed the level of development Barrios has gone through to win this award. And of course Kolokotronis definitely deserves a new deal along with our Greek homegrown striker for the clutch moments they provided. Kolokotronis is an IRL talent who is in the youth teams for Olympiacos at this moment.

![Screenshot 2025-09-26 153957.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20153957.png)

How he managed to do it I will never know but I'm happy with who is incoming because they are good aerially which is useful. He is liking the lure of the Premier League so maybe I can use that interest to really move him on given he wants to play there and he is touching 30.

Before the final of course came the Greek Cup Final which was another derby against Panathanaikos and we GODDAMN DELIVERED.

A defensive masterclass given they had no shots on target with their attack having the likes of Pellistri, Milik and Tete(Ex Man United, Juve and Leicester players) this was a HUGE thing. With Scottie Mctominay finally firing he scored the first one and then a Yazici penalty really helped(He was having a bit of a rare dry spell since his injury so he needed this) and then our Greek super talent in Kolokotronis put the final touch to the scoreline.

And with that we did a clean sweep in Greece at the very least:

Don isn't angry and that is all that matters ðŸ˜‚.

Then finally it was the last match and if we could create the same history again by becoming the first Greek team to win a European trophy I would be goddamn chuffed. It was kind of glitched because it still shows that Olympiacos won the Conference League when the real simulation of the first season saw Stuttgart win the Conference League actually so I will be counting this as Olympiacos' first European trophy if we won this.

And win it we did with another brilliant performance when it mattered.

And with that baby has faced his first ever Conference League winning animation.

Forget that fake entry there. We won Olympiacos' first ever European Trophy.

First was a great goal after a cross by Amadou Onana and Provodel made a rash call coming out for the ball and Yazici beat him to the ball scoring the opener. And then Wague managed to run forward and his cross was hit home by Perrone to make it two and he was left so unmarked compared to the 3 players further forward.

And with that we won a brilliant treble and our first European trophy in this journeyman save game.

![Screenshot 2025-09-26 170414.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-26%20170414.png)

And with that our reputation officially touched four stars after this treble as well and it brings our official trophy count so far to 10 now. I so badly wish we had that level of history. A top job would definitely be ours ðŸ˜¢.

For a bit of a recap we have won:

* The I-League

* The Indian Super League

* The Durand Cup

* The Hero Super Cup all with Aizawl FC

* The Yelo League

* The Saudi Pro League

* The Saudi King's Cup with Al-Fayha

* The Turkish Cup with Trabzonspor

* The Greek Super League

* The Greek Cup

* UEFA Europa Conference League with Olynpiacos

It's not a bad resume as a whole and now with an official UEFA trophy in the books the only way to go is up.

In terms of the job search, Real Sociedad was the aim for a while because of their bulky bank balance + transfer budget but the fraud Roberto Martinez escaped the sack after being in insecure for so long. So given that closed off I will be looking for a mid season job swap if I can because I have more than enough miles 4279 to be exact. So we could try for a bigger job mid season whenever any open up.

## Transfer plans will be fairly muted given I am only focusing on a mid season job swap soon
