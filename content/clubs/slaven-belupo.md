This isn't quite Dinamo Zagreb or Hajduk Split who are the top dogs in the HNL but they are a constant team that is around Europe most times from what I see. And the Belupo is a name for their title sponsor.

There aren't any trophies to really write home about in real life but they have won one in this save game which was the Croatian Cup in 2028.

## Origins & Evolution

Founded: August 20, 1912, in Koprivnica, Croatia.

The club traces its roots to a student team formed in 1907, officially taking the name “Slaven” in 1912.

Through its history, the club has changed names several times due to sponsorship and financial reasons. The “Belupo” part comes from its sponsorship agreement with the Koprivnica-based pharmaceutical company Belupo.

## Domestic Performance

Top Flight Established: Gained promotion to Croatia's 1st division (Prva HNL) in 1997 and has never been relegated since then—a remarkable feat for a club outside Croatia’s major cities.

Best League Finish: 2nd place in 2008, their highest-ever position in the Croatian top flight.

Croatian Cup: Twice runners-up (2007, 2016); no major domestic silverware. Both times, they lost in the final but qualified for European football as a result.(There is one trophy in 2028 that is added in the screenshot below)

## European Pedigree

Regular European qualifiers—especially notable for their performances in the now-defunct Intertoto Cup, where they were one of the most successful teams historically.

Achieved the club’s biggest European result by qualifying for the UEFA Cup through a win against Aris (Greece) in 2008.

Notable matches against prominent European clubs such as Aston Villa, Stuttgart, Galatasaray, and Athletic Bilbao, mostly via the Intertoto and Europa League qualifying rounds.

Never reached Champions League group stages, but consistent appearances in qualifying rounds have given the club valuable European experience and reputation.

## Reputation & Identity

Nicknamed: “Farmaceuti” (The Pharmacists), owing to their Belupo sponsorship.

Based in Koprivnica, they are the pride of a smaller city, known for strong community support and producing solid professionals despite lacking the resources of Croatia’s giants (Dinamo Zagreb, Hajduk Split).

**Supporters:** The “Podravske štuke” (Podravska Pike), organized in 2023, are their core fan group.
