A lot of things went down and is going to go down in what could be a massive chapter in our time in Saudi Arabia. Let's walk through a match against Al-Fateh who were in the top 4 along with us which was another freaking comeback after we bottled a 1-0 lead.

I am glad their accuracy was shambolic for once because seeing our accuracy being horrible for a long time is always infuriating. Like I said it was an humdinger once again. I was shocked when we were so dominant and they were the ones who went ahead so after a big bollocking at half-time they managed to bring the points home. And Pellegri who was coming back from his hamstring injury came on and was an amazing super sub to bring us ahead and we managed to win the game. The red card at the end was basically the last kick of the game so it didn't make much of a difference.

Then it was the deciding match against Al-Nassr where we needed to win and let me just say we made it difficult on ourselves ðŸ˜…

And to add to it Martinez our keeper has a long term injury and he'll only be back by May.

So our backup finally had his debut so to speak(His ability hasn't really warranted a start to be honest) and Al-Nassr scoring 2 goals shows why.

But with that: WE ARE SAUDI PRO LEAGUE CHAMPIONS

This feels like a freaking dream to be honest. Seeing our tactic working so well. The set piece domination. Everything about it really.

![Screenshot 2025-09-05 112445.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-05%20112445.png)

83 goals in the freaking Saudi Pro League with games still left to go feels amazing after scoring 100+ goals in the Yelo League.

Oh yeah I almost forgot

## Remember the player I said I was trying to convince to join me in the summer?

Well feast your eyes on this:

![Screenshot 2025-09-05 115155.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-05%20115155.png)

Artem Dovbyk. His negotiations were so strained for so long because his wages were a lot to be honest. But after a while I managed to get him to agree on a contract. But we managed to move past Al-Hilal and the likes of the other big Saudi Pro League clubs to make his transfer happen.

![Screenshot 2025-09-05 121309.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-05%20121309.png)

He is the perfect replacement for Pellegri and what is even better is that Pellegri has interest from Marseille and Al-Tai at this moment:

![Screenshot 2025-09-05 115134.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-05%20115134.png)

So I am open to really moving him and Oukhadda on and that would be some good sales for us really. Because I brought them in on a free and 100K GBP respectively.

## Absolute cinema for the King's Cup

And in the King's Cup well let's walk through the other matches we played on the way to the final.

First up was a dominant win against Al-Fateh

Vitik from those set pieces. Before his major injury he was a unit from set pieces. And in the end our Saudi striker on loan he was perfect.

Then of course we had the mega match against Al-Jeel in the Yelo League which you can find [here](https://charlescsr.github.io/india-2-manchester/posts/lot-to-think-about/)

Next was a very narrow win against Al-Wehda and the goal that was the winner was a thing of freaking beauty from Baturina.

You've heard of Ankara Messi. Well take it away Ankara Baturina:

It shocked the hell out of me. And it also shocked me how we didn't score more. But it was a win nonetheless.

Then it was a big win against Al-Khaleej who were in the Yelo League too but have been confirmed to be promoted to the Saudi Pro League.

![Screenshot 2025-09-05 122919.png](/india-2-manchester/images/Screenshot%202025-09-05%20122919.png)

Really dominant. And with Al-Faisaly beating freaking Al-Ittihad(They were recently confirmed to be promoted too) it is a derby for 500 miles in the King's Cup final.

This kind of derby is honestly very close to a Milan derby in Saudi because we share a stadium with them. Hence this is an Al-Majma'ah derby because well we're from the same city and share the same stadium.

## Can we win the double and add 500 miles to our bank? Let's see
