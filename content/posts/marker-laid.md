The team gelled fantastically. The cohesion has gone right to the middle and it is all showing in the pitch with an unbeaten start to the league. Problem is Sudeva Delhi who got promoted from the I-League 2 are at a similar record too which shocked me because they were favorites to go back down. They have more draws which meant:

## We are top of the I-League for now

2 points separate us from Sudeva Delhi and January starts off against them. It's a foreign attack versus a foreign defense. Should be a cracker.

Looking at the games we played, these were the standouts from the first half.

### Beating Sreenidhi Deccan who were shown to finish 2nd in the media predictions

Absolutely dominant. The familiarity plus the better sharpness caught them out perfectly. And the team was set from then on.

### Breaking a draw in brilliant style against Real Kashmir

This was amazing. I thought it'd be straightforward at half time given it was 2-0 just to get 2 slaps from them at the beginning of the second half which shut me right up. After some tinkering through the second half we demolished them and set the record for the biggest win in the history of Aizawl FC with our disgruntled (former)Team Leader scoring a hat-trick.

### A back and forth in our rivalry match against Neroca

Well played offside traps and our (unexpected) record signing coming in clutch. It was some well played set pieces which let our record signing(I say unexpected because I didn't realize we put the money entirely upfront instead of instalments). Also I was so happy when we played those offside traps not once but twice. And then the remaining goal at the end of the second half was a well made counter attack.

## Ratings so far

The main thing to remember is our top scorer at the moment did put in a transfer request because of a broken promise.

He will be joining towards the end of the transfer window. Atleast we're selling him for a good profit with 17k GBP atleast upfront which will go up to atleast 25k GBP. And I also have a person in place to replace him. I want to probably bring another foreigner in either on the wings or upfront. Because we are creating chances but just can't seem to finish them. It was seen in our only draw of the season so far. So we might finally unregister our foreign keeper because he has gone down a lot lately too.
