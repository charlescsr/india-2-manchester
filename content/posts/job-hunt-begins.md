I was watching more and more of the jobs around in the Middle East and from the clubs out there. And I narrowed it down to these ones which I did apply to:

In the order they are displayed:

* Al-Fayha: Recently relegated in the Saudi Pro League. Best finances out of the lot. And gives us a similar journey to Aizawl from the second division to the Pro League.
* Al-Mesaimeer: Recently relegated from the Qatar's top division. Another similar storyline really. Finances fairly strong too given it said Secure.
* Al-Wakrah: A team I was following for a while after the previous manager was under threat of the sack and after the playoff match was completed it became official that they got relegated and with that got rid of the manager
* Qatar SC: Out of nowhere this happened really. Probably the biggest reputation club to manage for to be honest when the previous manager resigned. Could have a lot of people swirling for this job but I applied nonetheless

I did want to properly go in the Saudi Pro League but some of the jobs that were in danger but were still in the league decided to stick with their managers. And also Al-Jazira in the UAE decided to stick with their manager so that job opportunity closed out too.

So after some half hearted managing of Aizawl like some minor transfers and all, I got some interviews to handle. First up was Al-Messaimeer but in the end they decided not to go for me. Felt weird really but didn't think much of it. Next up was Al-Fayha and their objectives aligned with what I wanted to. I wanted them back in the Saudi Pro League IMMEDIATELY. So everything aligned but the day the contract offer came I had a momentary pause:

I was watching the news around Qatar SC and a lot of people were vying for that job and seeing most of them have the highest possible coaching badges in the end it was a straightforward decision to go ahead with Al-Fayha.

And the contract was signed, documents exchanged and it was finally official.

## I made the move to the Middle East

We are building a steady journey. And it is going to be a similar journey but super charged with Saudi finances(I mean having a 41M balance plus 10M budget over barely 500k in Aizawl is everything).

## The journey so far

This was the place where this club was at:

I don't know why Al-Raed got a manager in fairly late so because of that that job closed up real quick. But this time we got a place which was much better in Al-Fayha.

## So after using the miles we had(3430) we use 3220 of them to reach Al-Fayha. So we are left with 210 miles in the bank
