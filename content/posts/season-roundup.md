Given I don't see United being taken over or them removing their current coach in Valverde I want to just be concise in what I am doing until the job ever opens up. United are a fairly okay side to now finally qualify to the Champions League now but their finances are very poor I don't know how they are not getting taken over yet but FREAKING Liverpool have a GODDAMN tycoon to add to their mega bank which just angered me even more.

## Anyway back to our season

We managed to come all the way to the top of the league and unfortunately in the Champions League we went out to the eventual winners in Arsenal which I couldn't be that fussed about when they overturned a 1-0 lead from the first leg very easily.

But we managed to sweep the rest of the trophies in Italy by bringing another Scudetto plus Coppa Italia

It also felt nice to sweep the awards and this made me feel nice because it was a star turn of a manager change at the right time

Both matches that were important for us to win the league and cup wound up being very tight which really made me realize how different things are here in Italy.

And with the summer coming in I managed to bring in some elite talent as well as trying to bring the age of the squad down. Almost a 100M spent after seeing to some sales.

Some signings were to help the commercial revenue like Gaya and Ake and a good majority were youngsters to try and develop home grown at club for registration in both the league and the UEFA competitions. Other than that we managed to bring in some good players.

And one surprise which I couldn't really pass up on was this guy:

We got an optional fee of 59M and with some sales we could make it happen. Let's see.

Right now this is how our expectations look like for this upcoming season

So let's see if we can give more of the same from last season and if we can be more competitive in the Champions League.
