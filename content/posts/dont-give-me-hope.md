Your eyes are not deceiving you either. I was shocked too. We are FAVORITES to win the I League and get promotion to the Indian Super League.

It all started when I realised how bad our center back depth was. And the team leader who I coaxed into a new contract wanted more depth. He wasn't impressed with the Indian CB's I brought in which I sort of understood because they weren't 3 stars but only 2 and half stars.

So from the clubs that offered me some players I went scouting the actual club that offered me a player in another position to see someone I could bring in and I brought this guy in:

He's good in terms of star rating but seems to have a mistake in him in the friendlies we did play so I'm not sure if he will start every game. Given I angered the foreign winger I could technically make it a complete foreign defense bar the keeper.

After bringing in this guy when I checked the media prediction for the I-League was when the shock from the top image happened. And what's even more amazing was we had our LB, Keeper and our piece de resistance in the media dream 11.

Honestly it's been a hard task to get good cohesion. The familiarity is growing well in the friendlies which is much needed but it's annoying to see how the cohesion isn't improving. Maybe it could be due to the fact that it's only friendlies. We'll see when the league begins. If we can win the I-League maybe there doesn't need to be that much pressure on the Super Cup given that involves ISL teams too. So if we get 500 miles it's good. A 1000 with the Super Cup would be even better.

It's just a matter of keeping people fit in facilities which aren't the best.
