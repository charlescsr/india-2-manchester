I was watching Job security ever since I came to the realization that it is difficult to ever dislodge to 3 horsemen of the Turkish Super League. Our mile bank currently stands at 2270 which means we have some of the major nations finally available.

I did keep an eye on the Athletic Bilbao job because they were dangerously close to being out of Europe but in the end they survived and so did their boss

I did think of doing a betrayal by going for the Besiktas job(The "Come to Besiktas" meme would be so overused trust me ðŸ˜‚) but so many top names wanted it so I had to be realistic. And also my lack of a trophy record(Even if I won 6 technically) is a bit of a deterrent to clubs now. So I needed a place that gave me a guaranteed shot at trophies. And even if it is a sideways step technically the Olympiacos job perked my ears.

They finished 4th in their Championship Group which meant they had to do Conference League football(This is qualifying rounds again there) so they sacked their manager. This could be a good shout actually because:

* This is a fallen giant(Their manager getting only 4th with this squad feels pretty pathetic)
* And a low level European Competition should be something that should be winnable and has to be winnable
* And we have a chance to clean sweep the trophies here

And also keep in mind we have a lot of miles ready if something big should come up either way. Being here is a positive. So I decided to go for it after the bigger jobs like Monaco and Lazio rejected me(This is why I said my "lack of" trophy record was a deterrent)

Let me tell you when I saw who the Owner was my heart dropped, stopped, every single damn thing:

Vangelis Marinakis. The "football don" of Nottingham Forest. To give an idea on why I gave him that nickname he did something at Nottingham Forest I never thought would happen. A team matched the release clause of one of his players and he made one complaint to the head honcho in England and the transfer was denied. And the player signed a new contract and the whole video looked wildly uncomfortable honestly.

I didn't realize that he was posted at the owner here and not in England but in a way we have the same goal. We are ambitious.

And after a while of simming and a disappointing takeover at Rennes which was just an Underwriter(I had enough of that at Al-Fayha), I decided to move forward with the interview at Olympiacos

This wouldn't have goddamn happened if I FIXED THE SAVE properly. No use crying over spilt milk.

But after the interview happened the job offer was fairly swift(Never expected nothing less from the football don). This will use only 354 miles roughly leaving us with 1916 in the bank by the way.

I usually have a max of two promises maybe for a new job but this guy forced me for 3. I tried to hold on but in the end the intimidation was too much. But the contract was accepted and the deal was official:

## Well, time to rebuild a fallen giant with the Don of Greek Football
