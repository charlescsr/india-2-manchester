The first time I've really been involved in a relegation scrap. Even in my other unemployed save my first team was only mid table actually before I managed to move them forward. And seeing the way it looks it is going to be scary. We have to be on it from now on to make sure we make the great escape.

After the transfer window it was a normal time really. And I mean normal in the sense of as normal as it can be for a bottom of the table club really.

We started off with an unlikely win against Tiddim Road FC(They're a club in Manipur if the name doesn't ring a bell)

Seems like the our matches tend to either be a poor shooting game like this or a non lethal game really. I would have taken a draw but I tried a Hail Mary like no other playing 3 strikers up front and it paid off after a shot from our left back crashed against the cross bar and one of the 3 people in the box was there to get the rebound thankfully which gave us important points.

Then it was a win against our relegation rivals in Namdhari FC

Probably our most dominant win in my tenure till now. Remember when I said I brought in a full back who was a better natural at striker? That was the guy who popped up with the goal in the 74th minute which surprised the hell out of me. Our set pieces have improved after bringing in my old routines too which really helps.

Then it was an inevitable loss to Kerala FC who were towards the top of the I-League.

We held on for so long until the I-League's only Tajik player  scored the winner for them. Our attack was barely non existent despite everything I tried and we couldn't find a way to do anything in attack.

Then a decent enough draw against Rajasthan United who are further up in the mid table

Our set piece routines worked well once again but the injury we got that early to one of our youth prospects absoltely dented our attack really. And a dodgy penalty later they scored it. How our xG is lower than theirs when we have 5/8 shots on target when they only had 1/8 I will never know.

Then a bit of a respectable draw against Real Kashmir who thumped us 4-1 last time out.

Honestly this game really was the definition of a bad shooting match and I was surprised how much my team is suited to the direct passing style. Even with the high possession they got 12 shots away but only 3 on target. And we had the same shots on target too. Just all around weird/bore draw.

## This is how the relegation scrap looks like for the three teams involved in it

The main thing is to focus was a big win for Namdhari FC over Shillong Lajong recently which put them 3 points ahead of us. We still have one game in hand over them and our goal difference should keep us ahead provided we get a win somehow. The last 3 games against Churchill Brothers, Sreenidhi Deccan and Neroca....only one of them look winnable. And add to it the fact that my starting goalie and midfielder are going to be on international duty during the match against the League leaders(Sreenidhi Deccan) it might get ugly in that match too.

### Well this is the business end of the season. Can we do enough to stay up? We will find out soon
