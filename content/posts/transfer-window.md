The takeover seems to have been quashed so we kept plowing onwards with our transfers. And we brought in some well known names and some pretty nifty signings too to help us become a mid table team.

One thing that made me laugh really hard was seeing an intermediary offer me this player:

I thought he'd be a good signing but we would be paying a hefty compensation to Clermont because he had a professional contract incoming so I obviously had to withdraw the offer sadly.

But we got some good people till now. Let's walk through them all:

A free transfer from Bengaluru who actually looks like a good pickup. Another striker who I had of a similar star rating was absolutely awful even if he had a good finishing stat. So here's hoping our attack can look sharper with this guy.

It kept bugging me how my best DM was only 2 stars even if he was solid with his decision making. So I wanted this guy on a free and brought him in to be my mainstay DM. Seems good apart from his poor marking but maybe my defense can handle it hopefully.

I decided to shift tactics a bit. Last season I had 3 foreigners in my defense with one in the attack. I managed to keep said one in the attack after coaxing him to sign a new contract. And I managed to get this guy who is decent enough and tall enough for free. So I was thinking of using my 3 foreigners as the 2 full backs and one of the defenders because I know how much it was hard to find any good Indian fullbacks.

Jackichand Singh. A fairly well known name in Indian Football. Kind of like under the radar name. He was put up for sale by Inter Kashi and I decided to snap him up for 4.5k GBP beating the interest from other better clubs really. Looking at him he could be an occasional starter or super sub really but options are always good.

This was a necessary signing to make sure we avoid using our foreign keeper(Even if I made him captain). Chennaiyin wanted him gone and I came forward with 2k GBP for the guy. He is a good enough height really so let's see how he does.

Our new RB. Like I said I so badly needed a good full back who can hold his own when we got rinsed in the wings. So I brought this guy in. He won't decline thankfully so here's hoping he comes good. We got some guys in for backup as well if necessary.

A big signing and definitely useful for us. He isn't super old to decline and he could grow a teensy bit. So definitely I hope he will be a mainstay.

## Then our piece de resistance

From a 5 star star player who was 29 and who barely grew to this beast who is only 19. I am super chuffed to get him really. So I'm happy with that.

## How my lineup looks like now

At the very least the first 11 is good enough for probably mid table. I really am aiming for a good Super Cup run which will give us 500 miles. So I've set up a ton of friendlies between now and the start of the league to first establish cohesion and some extra income too. I want to have a bit of a more proactive system if I can. Being mindful at the back but also managing to push higher up if we can.

And also a good thing to mention is my first steps towards the top of coaching badges is underway for me as well which was amazing:
